# Extra Resources for CS-APA

## Readings & Quizzes

| | |
|---|---|
|[Programmed Lessons](https://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html) | Online Java textbook with quizzes and activities |
| [Java Programming: Wikibooks Edition](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming) | Free online textbook for learning Java. It is way more in depth than you'll need for this course, but the Preface, Getting Started, Language Fundamentals, and Classes & Objects sections overlap with the AP Java topic list.  | 
| [Blue Pelican Java](http://www.bluepelicanjava.com/userLogin_dwnLd.asp) | Free textbook, as long as you're okay trading your email address. |

## Coding Practice

The more you code, the better you get. 

| | |
|---|---|
|[CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java)|Coding Bat is the granddaddy of coding practice sites. It's a huge collection of short methods that all target a specific task. |
|[W3 Resource: Java](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/) | Giant collection of Java problems with solutions |


## Non Java / AP Specific

Any coding gets you better at writing and understanding code. It doesn't always have to be specific to the AP exam or even Java. Below are some other sites I've come across to get some extra work in. And bonus, they tend to be kind of fun. Some of these may have a paid version, but last time I checked they all had a pretty decent free offering as well. 

| | |
|---|---|
| [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/) | An online world that you can explore using code. There's a lot to explore in the free version, except unfortunately they charge for the Java version. But, there's a free JavaScript version and that's pretty close to the syntax of Java |
| [code.org](https://code.org) | |
| [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) | Not specifically a coding problem, but a collection of math problems that can be solved with code |
| [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) | |
| [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) | USA Computing Olympiad |
| [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) | |
